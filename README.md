# Android Ciphers

This is a simple project that shows, through JUnit tests, how to use some sensible default cryptographic ciphers
available on the Android platform.

Take a look at `app/src/androidTest/java` to see the actual JUnit tests and the sensible defaults.

Also, you may wish to checkout the submodule `bouncycastle` to actually browse the BouncyCastle code included in all
Android systems and exposed through the `javax.crypto` API.
